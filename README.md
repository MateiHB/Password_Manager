# Password_Manager

*Password Manager* is a project that I did to further my knowledge of *C#* and more specifically *Winforms*. 

It started as a need to generate passwords with random characters and became a complex application that can also generate *Crypto Seed Phrases* and transform *Text* into a *Password*. 

I also added the ability to store the passwords on a *CSV* file. To store them securely, I implemented a system that encrypts the data before writting it on the file. The passwords and account names are therefore encrypted on the file and decrypted when reading the file and displaying the information on the screen.
